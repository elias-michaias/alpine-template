# alpine-template

A template for the web based on Alpine.js.
Based off of `create-alpine-app`, it includes conveniences like Tailwind and PostCSS.

Beyond those, I've also included several libraries and Plugins with the goal of 
completing Alpine and building it into a more monolithic framework.

The goal of this template is to fully actualize HTML as a cohesive language on its own,
and optimize productivity. Alpine's native features make front-end seamless, Tailwind
removes the need for fiddling with CSS, Alpine AJAX makes server requests
a breeze, and the other libraries includes like VimeshUI and Pinecone Router bring in 
conveniences like component abstraction and routing that Alpine would normally expect
a back-end templating solution for. This is my personal setup for doing as much development
as possible without leaving my markup.
